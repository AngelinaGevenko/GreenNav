# Green Navigation webapp

This is the main webapp of the project, live at [https://green-navigation.firebaseapp.com/](https://green-navigation.firebaseapp.com/). Integrate all new features here.


## Setup instructions

1. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the Firebase CLI via npm:

`npm install -g firebase-tools`

This installs the globally available firebase command. To update to the latest version, simply re-run the same command.

2. Run `firebase serve` to test the site locally.

3. When you are ready to deploy the site, run `firebase deploy`. Note that you need to be added as a contributor on the project console on Firebase. Everyone who contributed to the project during Google Summer of Code 2016 (both students and mentors) already have permissions to access the Firebase console and deploy new versions of the webapp.
