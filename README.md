# gn-notification

GreenNav polymer element for user dialogs and notifications.

## Project Idea

The idea is to create a smart notification system showing directions of the calculated route as well as every other useful information about current position. Furthermore this module should be open enough to handle data / informations added in future.

## TODO

Current state is just basic structure from [Polymer seed-element](https://github.com/PolymerElements/seed-element).

### Soon

- [ ] Show debug messages from other modules
- [ ] Show directions (Webapp)
- [ ] Show useful information about traffic (Webapp)
- [ ] Show useful information about current position (Webapp)

### Maybe in Future

- [ ] Add voice output (?)
- [ ] Implement Google Authentificaiton
